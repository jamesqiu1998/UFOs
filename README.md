Once a criteria has been entered, apply the filter by clicking anywhere else on the webpage. This is done through the updateFilter function.

## Summary
- One of the drawback for this new design is that not everyone is aware of the different options available. Two recommandations will be to change the filter table from input box to drop down list. This allows user to visualize the different options available, and also to include a "Filter" button or by pressing the enter key. This allows for more web interaction with the user.
